The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the specificity of CSS selectors:

```css
div p {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}
```

In this scenario, both selectors target the `p` element. However, the first selector (`div p`) is more specific because it targets `p` elements that are descendants of `div` elements. As a result, the `color: blue` declaration will take precedence over `color: red`, even though it appears later in the stylesheet.
