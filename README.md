# CSS Specificity Issue

This repository demonstrates a subtle but important issue related to CSS selector specificity. The `bug.css` file contains CSS rules that highlight how a more specific selector can override a less specific selector, even if it appears later in the stylesheet. This can lead to unexpected styling results.  The solution, in `bugSolution.css`, provides a clearer and more maintainable approach.

## Problem:

The unexpected behavior arises from the specificity of CSS selectors.  The more specific selector wins, even if it is declared later. This is a common source of confusion for developers.  The detailed explanation is within the code comments.

## Solution:

The solution file demonstrates how to improve the code's readability and maintainability to avoid this issue in the future.  Consider restructuring the CSS to avoid ambiguity and ensure intuitive selector ordering.
