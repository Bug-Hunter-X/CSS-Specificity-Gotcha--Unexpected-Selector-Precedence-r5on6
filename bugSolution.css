The solution involves restructuring the CSS to enhance clarity and predictability:

```css
p {
  color: red; /* Default color for all paragraphs */
}
div p {
  color: blue; /* Override color for paragraphs within divs */
}
```

Alternatively, we can use more specific selectors to avoid conflicts, perhaps introducing a class instead:

```css
.special-paragraph {
  color: blue;
}
```
Then, apply this class directly to the affected paragraphs in the HTML.

This improved structure makes the CSS easier to understand and maintain, reducing the likelihood of unexpected behavior caused by specificity issues.
